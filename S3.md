# S3

## Buckets

- Must have globally unique name.
- Store objects (files) in directories (buckets)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Naming convention:
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP

## Objects

- Objects have a key.
- URL = full path, s3://mybucket/my_folder/filename.txt
- There is no concept of directories.
- Multi part upload and max size 100mb.

## S3 Versioning

- You have to enable it.
- Same key overwrite will increment the version.
- Prevents accidental delete as it only deletes a marker.
- You can manually delete a version of the object.

## S3 Encryption

- 4 Methods of encryption:
  - SSE-S3: encrypts objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - header must be set aws:sse
  - SSE-KMS: leverages AWS key management service to manage encryption keys
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - header must be set aws:kms
    - full control of rotation policy
    - KMS advantages: user control + audit trail
  - SSE-C: you manage your own encryption keys
    - AWS s3 does not store the encryption key you provided
    - Encryption key must be provided in HTTP header
    - To retrieve you need to provide same encryption key
  - Client Side Encryption
    - Client Library such as Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    - Clients must encrypt data before sending to S3
    - Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving s3
    - Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle

## Security

- User based
- Resource based
  - Bucket Policies: bucket wide rules from s3 console
    - JSON based policies (statement.sid|effect|principal|action|resource)
- Block Public Access
  - 4 options etc.
- Networking: Supports VPC endpoints
- Logging and Audit: S3 Access Logs can be stored in S3 Bucket
- API calls can be logged in AWS Cloudtrail
- User security:
  - MFA delete (in versioned objects)
  - Pre-Signed URLs: URLs that are valid only for a limited time

## S3 Websites

- Need to make public bucket.
- Need to add Bucket Policy to allow everyone to get object.

## S3 Cors

- Origin: scheme (protocol) + host (domain) + port
  - https://www.example.com => https (scheme) + www.example.com (host) + 443 (port, implied)
- CORS: Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Web Browser based mechanism. Can make request from origin A only if origin B allows it.
- Access-Control-Allow-Origin => must be allowed by origin B.
- Preflight request (OPTIONS) => returns preflight response

## Consistency Model

- Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects.
- PUT 200 -> GET 200
- GET 404 -> PUT 200 -> GET 404 (eventually consistent)
- DELETE 200 -> GET 200 (if you do it very fast, eventually consistent)
- PUT 200 -> PUT 200 -> GET 200 (can get old version)
- No way to ensure STRONG CONSISTENCY.
