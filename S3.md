# S3

## Buckets

- Must have globally unique name.
- Store objects (files) in directories (buckets)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Naming convention:
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters long
  - Not an IP
  -


## Objects

- Objects have a key.
- URL = full path, s3://mybucket/my_folder/filename.txt
- There is no concept of directories.

## S3 Versioning

- You have to enable it.
- Same key overwrite will increment the version.
- Prevents accidental delete as it only deletes a marker.
- You can manually delete a version of the object.

## S3 Encryption

- 4 Methods of encryption:
  - SSE-S3: encyprs objects using keys handled & managed by AWS
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - header must be set aws:sse
  - SSE-KMS: leverages AWS key management service to manage encryption keys
    - Object is encrypted server side
    - header must be set aws:kms
    - KMS advantages: user control + audit trail
  - SSE-C: you manage your own encryption keys
    - AWS s3 does not store the encryption key you provided
    - Encryption key must be provided in HTTP header
    - To retrieve you need to provide same encryption key
  - Client Side Encryption
    - Client Library such as Amazon S3 Encryption Client
    - Clients must encrypt data before sending to S3
    - Clients must decrypt data themselves when retrieving s3
    - Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle
